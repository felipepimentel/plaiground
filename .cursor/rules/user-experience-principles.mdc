# User Experience Principles

## Core Philosophy

Plaiground's UX is built around these foundational principles:

1. **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Simplify complex MCP interactions without hiding power
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Provide real-time responses to all user actions
3. **Progressive Discovery**: Layer complexity so users can discover advanced features as needed
4. **Visual Clarity**: Use visual cues to represent complex protocol relationships
5. **Contextual Help**: Embed assistance where users need it, not isolated in documentation

## Key UX Patterns

### Information Architecture

- Organize interfaces from simple to complex
- Group related functionality spatially
- Use consistent navigation patterns
- Provide clear paths for common workflows
- Maintain persistent workspace context

### Interaction Design

- Minimize clicks for common actions
- Support keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Provide drag-and-drop where appropriate
- Use consistent interaction patterns
- Animate transitions meaningfully to show relationships

### Visual Design

- Use color to indicate state and relationships
- Apply consistent spacing and alignment
- Implement a clear typography hierarchy
- Design for both light and dark modes
- Use purposeful animations for feedback

## Developer-Centric Features

### Code Generation

- Automatically generate code snippets for server interactions
- Support multiple languages and frameworks
- Allow customization of generated code
- Provide copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Show code that works immediately without modification

### Debugging Experience

- Highlight errors with clear explanations
- Show relevant context for debugging
- Provide suggested fixes for common issues
- Enable time-travel debugging where possible
- Integrate logs meaningfully with protocol visualization

### Testing Workflows

- Support rapid iteration of test cases
- Enable saving and sharing of test configurations
- Provide template-based starting points
- Allow batch testing for regression checks
- Visualize test results clearly

## Performance Considerations

The UI must remain responsive with:

- Large message payloads (10MB+)
- High message frequency (100+ messages/second)
- Multiple simultaneous connections
- Long-running operations
- Complex visualizations

## Accessibility Standards

All interfaces must:

- Support keyboard navigation
- Work with screen readers
- Maintain sufficient contrast
- Support zoom and text resizing
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
