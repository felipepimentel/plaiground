# Feature Priorities

## Core Principles

All feature development should follow these principles:

1. **User Experience First**: Prioritize features that improve the developer experience
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, then enhance
3. **Incremental Value**: Each feature should provide value on its own
4. **Quality Over Quantity**: Do fewer things better rather than more things poorly

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

Focus on establishing core architecture and essential MCP testing capabilities:

- [ ] Basic MCP Host implementation
- [ ] Reliable MCP Client implementation
- [ ] Server connection management
- [ ] Simple resource browser
- [ ] Basic tool testing interface
- [ ] Protocol message inspection
- [ ] Core UI components

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX

Improve the user experience with key visual features:

- [ ] Visual Flow Designer (basic functionality)
- [ ] Split-view comparison tool
- [ ] Improved resource browser with search and filtering
- [ ] History and session management
- [ ] Improved error handling and visualization
- [ ] Settings and preferences management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

Add powerful capabilities for more complex testing and debugging:

- [ ] Real-time collaboration
- [ ] Advanced Visual Flow Designer
- [ ] Server Blueprint Generation
- [ ] Performance analytics dashboard
- [ ] AI-assisted debugging
- [ ] Visual protocol tracing
- [ ] Export/import of test scenarios

### Phase 4: Ecosystem

Extend the platform to integrate with the broader development ecosystem:

- [ ] Plugin system for custom extensions
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] API for programmatic access
- [ ] Advanced authentication and security features
- [ ] Enterprise features (user management, team collaboration)

## Current Focus

The team is currently focused on these immediate priorities:

1. Completing the core MCP Host implementation
2. Building the initial client UI with basic MCP server testing capabilities
3. Implementing the resource browser and tool testing interfaces
4. Setting up proper testing infrastructure

## Feature Request Guidelines

When proposing new features, consider:

1. How does it align with our core principles?
2. Which development phase does it belong in?
3. What specific user problems does it solve?
4. What are the implementation requirements and dependencies?
5. How would we measure success for this feature?
