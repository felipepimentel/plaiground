# MCP Host Implementation

## Architecture Overview

The MCP Host is the core component that orchestrates communication between clients and servers. It:

1. Creates and manages MCP Client instances
2. Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle
3. Enforces security policies and consent requirements
4. Handles user authorization decisions
5. Coordinates context aggregation across clients

## Key Components

### HostManager

The `HostManager` serves as the central coordination point with these responsibilities:

- Client lifecycle management (creation, termination)
- Security policy enforcement
- Configuration management
- Event distribution

### ClientRegistry

The `ClientRegistry` maintains:

- Registry of active client connections
- Connection status tracking
- Resource allocation and cleanup

### SessionManager

The `SessionManager` handles:

- User session tracking
- Authentication state
- Permission grants
- Connection history

### CapabilityNegotiator

The `CapabilityNegotiator` manages:

- Server capability discovery
- Feature compatibility checking
- Protocol version negotiation

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Security Boundaries**: 
   - Each client should have strict isolation
   - Explicit permission model for resource access
   - Clear audit logging of all operations

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation when servers disconnect
   - Comprehensive error reporting
   - Reconnection strategies

3. **Performance**:
   - Efficient message routing
   - Resource pooling where appropriate
   - Minimal overhead for proxied communications

4. **Extensibility**:
   - Plugin architecture for custom capabilities
   - Protocol version compatibility
   - Feature detection and graceful fallbacks
